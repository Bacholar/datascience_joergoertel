## Stage 1: Business Case Foundation

## Business domain

We will create an application that can predict a given price of a stock, a commodity or a currency. The project will consist of different modules that communicate with each other to give the best possible result. The project must give the user an overall recommendation regarding the purchase and sale of securities. We believe that Data Science to a large extent makes sense to use in this context, as we are talking about being able to predict a result from a historical data. Our motivation for building the project is to be able to offer small investors an opportunity to trade better in various markets. 

## Hypothesis

Can we anticipate a stock in a given time interval with reasonable certainty.
